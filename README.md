# ShortestPath-Graphs
Three variants of the shortest path problem in graphs
V2V - Given vertices u and v, find the shortest path to from u to v. Such a path is referred to as V2V (u, v).
V2S - Given a vertex u and a set of vertices S, find the shortest path from u to some vertex in S. Such a path is referred to as V2S(u,S).
S2S - Given a set of vertices S1 and a set of vertices S2, find the shortest path from some vertex in S1 to some vertex in S2. Such a path is referred to as S2S(S1,S2).
